## Milestones

### Performance Review (between April 3rd and April 7th) :

The student team mentors will set up a personal 10-minute meeting with each of
the students in their team and give them feedback about their performance in the
course so far: What did they do well and where should they improve. As a student
you should take the time to think about how you perceive your own performance,
how is that different from how the mentors see it and why. Take the opportunity
to learn how to improve!

### Demo 3 (May 1st): Control logic and UI

The purpose of this demo is to review your ability to implement the application
workflow and UI logic and implement automated tests for it.

**Technical requirements**

1. Complete the implementation of one or more features of your application,
   including UI and backend logic. The features you implement should allow you
   to demonstrate your ability to:

    1. Query data from your database and present it to your users
    2. Use forms to gather user input
    3. Store or modify information in the database as a response to user input

2. Implement automated tests for the features you've completed. The tests 
   should cover all aspects of the feature's functionality including failure 
   scenarios, handling of invalid data and unauthorized access scenarios. 

**Demo contents**

Your demo presentation should include the following elements:

1. One or more video segments showing how the features you've implemented look
   and work from a user's point of view.
2. An explanation of how you've tested the features you've developed. You should
   include the following details:

    1. Which manual tests were carried out (If any). How does one decide if a 
       test was successful?
    2. Which automated tests were written
    3. Are failure scenarios being tested? In which way?
    4. What aspects of the features you've written are not being tested?
3. A demonstration of the application tests being run in GitHub actions.
